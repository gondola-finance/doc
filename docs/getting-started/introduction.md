# Introduction

Gondola finance is a fork of Saddle, focus on connecting assets on Avalanche.  We will begin with [Zero Exchange](https://www.0.exchange/)â€™s z-token, then expand our service to other platforms.  Our goal is to enable smooth asset transfer between fragmented liquidities via stableswap.

Our  philosophy  is  that  we  should  only add relevant tokens that  actually  provides  value  to  our users. Bridging z-tokens to native tokens in Avalanche C-chain allows more seamless asset transfer between Zero and Avalanche as of today. Each asset that we plan to support should serve a unique proposition. With that in mind, tokens to be supported at launch:

- ETH, zETH
- USDT, zUSDT
- DAI, zDAI
